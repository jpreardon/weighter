I'm going to run this first bit right off my [worklog from the float plan app](https://github.com/jpreardon/float-plan/blob/master/WORKLOG.md)...

- Set up a new environment on Cloud 9
- Rails 5 was already installed in the environment, upgraded to 6.
- Generate new SSH key an add to github
- Fetch a-new-day branch of the rewards repo from github
- Create new rails application
- Install yarn
- Update the gem file/bundle install
- Make a simple 'hello world' modification
- Create production group for postgresql gem
- Install heroku, deploy to production

I'm going to take this in a different direction, hopefully one that will yield faster results. The prior attempt at this was built on Express for the API and some very basic HTML/CSS/Javascript. I have been using it almost daily for quite a while, maybe two years.

In the interest of getting things done, I'm going to switch over to Ruby on Rails for the whole thing. If I ever want to plug in a different sort of front end, like a mobile app, Rails can serve as the API with little or no updates.

Here's a rough plan

- Get environment set up
- Get basic user auth working (I think I steal from the Sail Club App for this)
- Add weight tracking
- Import old weight data
- Push to prod, and use
- Add a simple visualization
- Post MVP trackers
  - Water
  - Exercise
  - Good habits (like journaling etc.)
  - Meal log
