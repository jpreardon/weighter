# Worklog

## 2019-11-03

I'm going to take this in a different direction, hopefully one that will yield faster results. The prior attempt at this was built on Express for the API and some very basic HTML/CSS/Javascript. I have been using it almost daily for quite a while, maybe two years.

In the interest of getting things done, I'm going to switch over to Ruby on Rails for the whole thing. If I ever want to plug in a different sort of front end, like a mobile app, Rails can serve as the API with little or no updates.

Here's a rough plan

- Get environment set up
- Get basic user auth working (I think I steal from the Sail Club App for this)
- Add weight tracking
- Import old weight data
- Push to prod, and use
- Add a simple visualization
- Post MVP trackers
  - Water
  - Exercise
  - Good habits (like journaling etc.)
  - Meal log
