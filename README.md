# Weighter

This is a super simple app that tracks weight, dailyâ€“if you wish.

## Setup

A config.php file is required in the same directory with the following parameters defined:

```
$dbdsn = 'DATA_SOURCE_NAME';
$dbusername = 'USERNAME';
$dbpassword = 'PASSWORD';
```

See [PHP PDO::__construct](https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.construct.php) for a through explanation of the data source name.
